# Genetics: Introduction, history, scope and achievements

## History

### Spontaneous generation and fixity of species

- Initial belief was that there is no need of transfer of biological material between generations (for at least mid $18^{th}$ century).
- Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) observed spontaneous appearance of flies from refuse (small infusoria "arising" from apparently clear infusions of hay)
- Redi's and Spallanzani's (1621-1697 and 1729-1799) experiment questioned this doctrine of "spontaneous generation". They showed fly larvae would not develop if adult flies are excluded from laying eggs on meat. 
- They sealed boiled the flasks and inferred on the non-appearance of tiny "animalcules" observed by Leeuwenhoek. However, they did left the possibility, citing their experiment of "tainted" (heated, in their sense of words) air, that whether unheated air could generate new organisms.
- Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries marked the beginnings of systematics. Linnaeus (1707-1778) mostly contributed to the knowledge.
- According to him, there was a "fixity of species".
- Two doctrines -- spontaneous generation and fixity of species -- were difficult to reconcile with each other.
- Both theories were put to rest by Pasteur (1822-1895) and by Tyndall (1820-1893) who showed that putrefaction of organic matter only occured under conditions that permitted solid particles to enter a nutrient culture. (These solid particles were identified to be microbes, later.)
- Consesus was that "every living thing from a living thing" ( _Omne vivum e vivo_).

### Preformationism and epigenesis

- Originally aristotle had proposed that an organism formed through sexual reproduction receives the "substance" of the female egg and a contribution of "form" by the male seminal fluid.
- The idea (generated by biologists during 17th and 18th century) that one of the sex cells, or gametes, either sperm or egg, contained within itself the entire organism in perfect miniature form ( _preform_ - ationism).
- Wolff advanced the idea that organisms develop from uniform embryonic tissues, idea of _epigenetics_, and later his successor von Baer (1792-1876) proposed the view that gradual transformation of increasingly specialized tissue make up an organism during development, and not the _de novo_ appearance of organs.

### Pangenesis and the history of acquired characters

- Charles Darwin (1809-1882) believed that very small, exact, but invisible copies of each body organ and component (gemmules) were transported by the bloodstream to the sex organs and there assembled into the gametes.
- This doctrine of "pangenesis" provided attraction for believers of evolution.
- According to this theory, the excess use or disuse of organ would alter its gemmules and consequently lead to a changed inheritance in the decendents -- inhertance of acquired characters take place.
- Most popular proponent was Lamarck (1744-1829).
- Work during later part of 19th century and beginning of 20th set the stage for characterization of source of heredity.

### Modern history of genetics

\small

- Developments in cytology in the 1800s had a strong influence on genetics. Building on the work of others, Matthias Jacob Schleiden (1804-1881) and Theodor Schwann (1810-1882) proposed the concept of the cell theory in 1839. Biologists began to examine cells to see how traits were transmitted in the course of cell division.
- Charles Darwin (1809-1882), one of the most influential biologists of the nineteenth century, put forth the theory of evolution through natural selection and published his ideas in On the Origin of Species in 1859.
- Walther Flemming (1843-1905) observed the division of chromosomes in 1879 and published a superb description of mitosis. By 1885, it was generally recognized that the nucleus contained the hereditary information.
- Near the close of the nineteenth century, August Weismann (1834-1914) finally laid to rest the notion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. He cut off the tails of mice for 22 consecutive generations and showed that the tail length in descendants remained stubbornly long.
- Weismann proposed the germplasm theory, which holds that the cells in the reproductive organs carry a complete set of genetic information that is passed to the egg and sperm.

### Crop improvement efforts of Nepal in recent past

- During 1990-2014, production of potato, sugarcane, wheat, maize and rice increased by 319.4%, 235.5%, 122.3%, 90.1% and 48.9%, respectively.
- Agricultural research and breeding works initiated since 1950 and 1951 respectively. During latter, selection of crops with desired characteristics was practiced.
- Systematic research in major cereals started from 1972 (Commodity programs were launched for Rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, potato)
- First breeder of Nepal, Netra Bahadur Basnyat introduced rice genotypes from Japan early in 1951. This followed a series of introduction of rice germplasm from India as well as evaluation (in Parwanipur agriculture station) and release as first variety. Simple mass selection was practiced for recommending CH-45 rice variety in 1959 and Lerma-52 in 1960.
- Rice breeding began with the introduction of indica type semi-dwarf Taiwanese varieties in Terai and intermediate types for Kathmandu valley.
- First successful attempts on hybridization was made by Gopal R. Rajbhandary in Potato during 1964.
- In early days (upto 1985), major breeding objective was to increase yield of main stable crops i.e. rice, wheat and maize. Later, it extended to other crops.
- In mid period (1985-2005), priority was given to developing biotic stresses, mainly disease resistant variety, followed by yield. Rice blast and wheat rust were the main diseases in the country from very beginning to current period of breeding history. 
- Later between 2005 and 2015, abiotic stresses mainly drought and quality aspects got priority in the breeding programs. 
- Majority breeding programs focused on screening the introduced germplasm, and genetics of specific traits in the local germplasm were not studied.
- Agriculture Botany Division started the preliminary plant breeding works mainly on rice, wheat and maize since 1966.
- Extensive plant breeding started after the establishment of five commodities (rice, wheat, maize, potato and sugarcane) research programs in 1972.
- Year 1966 saw improvements in field evaluation of pipeline genotypes. CVT, IET and observation nurseries were established in several locations for various cereal crops.
- First attempts on crossing of Rice and Wheat were made during 1968 by breeders.
- Tissue culture technique was first demonstrated in 1976 at National Herbarium and Plant Laboratories.
- Maintenance breeding works of Rice, wheat and maize were started in 1980s at NRRP, NWRP and NMRP respectively.
- Hybrid were first introduced for commercial cultivation of vegetables and maize by private sector during 1985. Prospects of hybrid development in maize started being explored since 1988 at NMRP, Rampur.
- Community engagement in plant breeding endeavor intensified between 1993 and 1996, wherein concepts of PPB, Community seed bank and PVS was being put into practice.
- Heterosis breeding in vegetable (commercial hybrid development) in tomato by Kedar Budathowki in 1998.
- Application of CMS lines in development of hybrids was first practiced by Bal K. Joshi during 1999.
- In 2000, application of DNA marker (SSR) in Rice for rapid characterization of genotypes was demonstrated in ABD.
- Wide hybridization $\longrightarrow$ Rice during 2001.
- In 2002 PCR based diagnosis protocol were developed for Citrus HLB detection at NAST and during 2005 SQCC started GMO testing.
- National genebank was established in 2010, starting with germplasm collection and preservation of cereals. Later during 2012/13 concept of field genebanks and DNA and tissue banks were introduced for various other crops.

- More than 100 organizations are currently involved in breeding activities in Nepal:
  - NARC, NAST (1982), Li-BIRD (1995), CEAPRED (1991), SEAN (1989)
- CIMMYT has been working since 1970 and IRRI started collaboration in Nepal since 1985.
- Universities:
  - Established: IAAS, TU (1972); Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, AFU (2010)
  - HICAST, PU (2000)
  - AFU (2010)
  - IAAS, Rampur started degree course on plant breeding since 1998.

- Before 2005, varietal breeding programs laid focus on wider adaptability of a test genotype without due regard to evolutionary breeding. Current trend is exactly opposite, due to recognition of diversity in climate and geography, needs of the farmers, and several other factors.
- Among three different breeding methods, namely, conventional, participatory, and modern plant breeding, conventional breeding dominates institutional research. 
- Introduction, mass selection, heterosis breeding, and maintenance breeding are practiced in Nepal for both self-pollinated and cross-pollinated crops. Mutation breeding, back crossing, pure line selection, bulk method, cultivars mixture, single seed descent, and pedigree method have been practised in self pollinated crops, while recurrent selection, synthetic variety, and population improvement are conducted out in cross pollinated crops. For vegetatively reproduced crops, different methods such as introduction, selection through clonal, and heterosis breeding are practiced.
- Shuttle breeding and participatory plant breeding are also practiced in Nepal.

### Biofortication

Essential mineral micronutrients are a prerequisite to maintain metabolism in all living organisms, and man obtains these from his diet. But, wheat, rice and maize as staple grains contain suboptimal quantities of micronutrients, especially iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). However smaller in quantities they are, most of this is removed by milling leading to micronutrient deficiency. Estimates of WHO point that nearly 25% of the world population has anaemia. Inadequate Zn intake and Zn deficiency faced by 17.3% of people lead to nearly 433,000 deaths among children aged below 5 years. Also, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is yet another serious form of malnutrition causing blindness while weakening the body's immune system causing morbidity and mortality.

Quantity of vitamins and minerals can be increased through biofortification, achieved by means of transgenic techniques. Rice was genetically engineered to produce beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, that finally culminated in the derivation of golden rice. Rice was later biofortified with lysine. Chinese researchers developed a gene-stacking approach capable of delivering many genes at once for rice endosperm to produce high levels of anthocyanin. Purple endosperm holds potential for reducing the risk of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other chronic disorders. China developed a highly efficient "TransGene Stacking II" that can assemble a large number of genes into a single vector for plant transformation. This system can transform up to eight anthocyanin pathway genes in the endosperm of the japonica and indica rice varieties. This system could provide a versatile toolkit for transgene stacking. The toolkit possesses a huge potential for synthetic biology (redesigning of existing biological systems).
