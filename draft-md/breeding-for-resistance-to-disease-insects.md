A crop parasite is defined as any organism that spends a major part of its life cycle inhabiting one host individual, and obtaining nutrients from that host. The host, of course, is a crop plant. A parasite may be an insect, mite, nematode, parasitic angiosperm (e.g. broomrape, witchweed, dodder), or any of the various categories of plant pathogen, such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. However, weeds are not parasites: they are competitors.

For the whole of the twentieth century, scientific plant breeding has had four main objectives. These were improvements in (i) yield; (ii) quality of crop product; (iii) agronomic suitability; and (iv) resistance to parasites. This scientific breeding has been remarkably successful in the first three of these objectives, but much less successful with breeding for resistance. The basic reason for this has been that resistance kept breaking down because of new strains of the parasite. There was then an apparently endless repetition of resistance failures and a 'boom and bust' cycle of cultivar production.

Vanderplank (1963, 1968) first made a clear distinction between single-gene and multiple-gene resistances to crop parasites. He called single-gene resistance "vertical resistance", and it is normally qualitative in that it provides complete protection or none at all, with no intermediates. He called multiple-gene (polygenic) resistance "horizontal resistance", and it is quantitative in that it can provide every degree of protection from a minimum to a maximum.

Any protection mechanism against a crop parasite may be described as unstable or stable. An unstable resistance is within the capacity for micro-evolutionary change of the parasite (parasite is able to produce a new strain that is unaffected by that protection, which is then said to have 'broken down'). Many synthetic insecticides and fungicides provide unstable protection, and they sooner or later break down in the face of new races, strains, biotypes or pathotypes of the parasite. Horizontal resistance provide stable protection, which is in contrast to the vertical resistance beyond the capacity for micro-evolutionary change of the parasite.

Advantages of vertical resistance:

- Provides complete protection against a parasite,
- Effective for a very wide climatic range and can be employed across broad geographical regions,
- Being controlled by single genes, it is amenable to gene-transfer and back-crossing techniques.

Disadvantages of vertical resistance:

- It is unstable,
- Responsible for the vertifolia effect, which is the gradual loss of horizontal resistance during breeding for vertical resistance,
- Occur only against some species of parasite.

Vertifolia effect

- Genetic changes resulting in erosion occur even when breeding is conducted under the protection of crop protection chemicals.
- This erosion occurs because horizontal resistance can be measured only in terms of the level of parasitism. If the level of parasitism is totally obscured by pesticides, or by a functioning vertical resistance, the level of horizontal resistance cannot be observed or assessed. Because individuals with the highest levels of horizontal resistance are always a minority in a screening population, less-resistant individuals are more likely to be selected on the basis of their other attributes.
- It has been particularly serious in potatoes, tomatoes and cotton, but there are few species in which it has not occurred.

The speed of this vertical resistance breakdown can vary greatly. The fastest occurs in the first growing season, and this happened with _Puccinia polysora_ of maize in tropical Africa (see below), and in Late potato blight ( _Phytophthora infestans_) in the Toluca Valley of Mexico, which is the centre of origin of this fungus.

Being a quantitative variable, horizontal resistance can be expressed at any level between a minimum and a maximum. However, unlike vertical resistance, even with maximum level of horizontal resistance, there is always some parasitism.

- Horizontal resistance is that it is durable,
- Possible to breed for increased levels of many different quantitative variables simultaneously.
